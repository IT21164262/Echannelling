# Echannelling
Java Servlet project is an e-channeling healthcare system that seamlessly integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly experience. This innovative system enables patients to schedule appointments with healthcare professionals through a
well-designed HTML interface. CSS ensures an appealing design, while JavaScript adds interactive features. My role centers on optimizing the Java Servlet backend for robust functionality and contributing to the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an
efficient and intuitive healthcare appointment scheduling system.
